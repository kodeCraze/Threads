### 4. Code Snippet README

```markdown
# Threads
A comprehensive Next.js 13.4 application with Server-Side Rendering, MongoDB, and more.

## Code Snippets

### Next.js 13.4 with Server-Side Rendering
```jsx
import NextApp from 'next/app';
import Head from 'next/head';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>Threads</title>
      </Head>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default NextApp(MyApp);
```

### MongoDB handling of complex schemas, multiple data population
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/threads', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

const threadSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  content: String,
  author: String,
});

const Thread = mongoose.model('Thread', threadSchema);

// Populate data
Thread.create({
  title: 'Hello World',
  content: 'This is a test thread.',
  author: 'John Doe',
}, (err, thread) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(thread);
  }
});
```

### Create beautiful layouts with TailwindCSS
```css
/* styles.css */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

.container {
  max-width: 800px;
